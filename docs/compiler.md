Compiler Design
====================

Parsing
-----------

- Things can be done in parser phase should be resolved in the parser.

ReCompiling
-------------

- When re-compiling files, the root file should also be re-compiled.
  - Files does not depend on the root file, doesn't need to be re-compiled again.
